    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>By day I am a hardworking, passionate, and energetic employee; by night I am an outgoing, laid back, and looking for that next great memory type of friend. I love to live in new cultures, experiment with new food dishes, and continually explore new passions that excite me. Although I enjoy being good at something, I’m more passionate about learning and developing at this stage in my life and believe that the outside lessons I learn, even my failures, only help me develop and grow in my professional and personal life.</p>
    <p>On a personal level, my friends and family are clear cut the most important things to me. Beyond that, living a healthy lifestyle and continuously exploring everything I can get my hands on is essential for me. I believe the ability to learn and create in a free environment is a privilege, and intend to take full advantage of that. </p>

    <p>I listen to a wide range of music, lately I’ve been flipping between classic rock and EDM.</p>
